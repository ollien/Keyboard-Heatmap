Keyboard Heatmap
================
A program which keeps track which keys were pressed most often, and displays them in a heatmap form, with keys that were pressed more often displayed brighter, and keys that were pressed less often darker. This is written in Java with JNativeHook. 

The layout is coded for MacOSX but it can be very easily changed to windows, just by changing the META key placement.

JNativeHook can be found here.
